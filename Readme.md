## Palindrome
This program is a Solo Learn Challenge designed to find out whether an input string is a palindrome or not. This program has two classes, node class and list class(doubly linked list). I wanted to use a doubly linked list to place every character in the node and using a pointer next to the head node and before the tail node, I iterate through the Linked list to check whether the two nodes have same data.
